# Curriculum vitae

This is my curriculum vitae. It is written in LaTeX and uses the [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) template.

In order to compile it, in addition to a LaTeX distribution, you will need to install the [FontAwesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) font (inside the `texlive-fonts-extra` package on Debian-based systems).
